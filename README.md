# Machine Vision and Deep Learning for Robotic Harvesting of Shiitake Mushrooms

This repository contains the code, documents, and datasets related to an MSc Dissertation project focused on utilising computer vision and robotic systems for harvesting shiitake mushrooms. The project was conducted within the Centre for Machine Vision at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.

**This project has since been presented in Oct`24 at the 19th Internation Symposion for Visual Computing in Lake Tahoe under the title '_Machine Vision and Deep LEarning for Robotic Harvesting of Shiitake Mushrooms._'**
Conference Paper can be found at [Springer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-77389-1_12)

## Project Aims and Objectives

### Aims

- To determine if current computer vision methods can be used to accurately count Shiitake mushrooms growing on a sawdust fruiting block.
- To investigate whether 3D imaging data will improve the detection of Shiitake mushrooms.
- To research whether 3D imaging can be used to plan the harvesting of Shiitake mushrooms with a robot arm.

### Objectives

- Create a dataset of Shiitake mushrooms using a 3D camera.
- Train a 2D and 3D object detection model to detect Shiitake mushrooms on the fruiting block.
- Create a program that will order the detected Shiitake mushrooms and number them in a logical order for harvest.
- Create a separate dataset of the mushroom stems and make a cut-point estimation program to determine suitable cut-points.
- Train a keypoint detection program to determine suitable cut-points
